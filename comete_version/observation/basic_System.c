  /proc/[pid]/stat
              Status  information  about  the process.  This is used by ps(1).
              It is defined in /usr/src/linux/fs/proc/array.c.

              The fields, in order, with their proper scanf(3)  format  speciâ
              fiers, are:

              pid %d      The process ID.

              comm %s     The  filename  of  the  executable,  in parentheses.
                          This is visible whether or  not  the  executable  is
                          swapped out.

              state %c    One  character  from  the string "RSDZTW" where R is
                          running, S is sleeping in an interruptible  wait,  D
                          is  waiting in uninterruptible disk sleep, Z is zomâ
                          bie, T is traced or stopped (on a signal), and W  is
                          paging.

              ppid %d     The PID of the parent.

              pgrp %d     The process group ID of the process.

              session %d  The session ID of the process.

              tty_nr %d   The controlling terminal of the process.  (The minor
                          device number is contained  in  the  combination  of
                          bits 31 to 20 and 7 to 0; the major device number is
                          in bits 15 t0 8.)

                          Details depend on the kernel version.

              minflt %lu  The  number  of  minor  faults  the process has made
                          which have not required loading a memory  page  from
                          disk.

                          waited-for children have made.

              majflt %lu  The number of major  faults  the  process  has  made
                          which have required loading a memory page from disk.

              cmajflt %lu The  number  of  major  faults  that  the  process's
                          waited-for children have made.

              utime %lu   Amount of time that this process has been  scheduled
                          in  user  mode,  measured  in clock ticks (divide by
                          sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).   This  includes  guest  time,

                          below), so that applications that are not  aware  of

                          their calculations.

              stime %lu   Amount of time that this process has been  scheduled
                          in  kernel  mode, measured in clock ticks (divide by
                          sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).

                          cguest_time (time spent running a virtual  CPU,  see
                          below).

              cstime %ld  Amount  of time that this process's waited-for chilâ

                          clock ticks (divide by sysconf(_SC_CLK_TCK).

              priority %ld
                          (Explanation  for Linux 2.6) For processes running a
                          real-time  scheduling  policy  (policy  below;   see
                          sched_setscheduler(2)), this is the negated schedulâ
                          ing priority, minus one; that is, a  number  in  the
                          range -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time prioriâ
                          ties 1 to 99.  For processes running  under  a  non-
                          real-time  scheduling  policy,  this is the raw nice
                          value (setpriority(2)) as represented in the kernel.
                          The  kernel  stores  nice  values  as numbers in the
                          range 0 (high) to 39  (low),  corresponding  to  the
                          user-visible nice range of -20 to 19.

                          Before  Linux  2.6, this was a scaled value based on
                          the scheduler weighting given to this process.

              nice %ld    The nice value (see setpriority(2)), a value in  the
                          range 19 (low priority) to -20 (high priority).

              num_threads %ld
                          Number of threads in this process (since Linux 2.6).
                          Before kernel 2.6, this field was hard coded to 0 as
                          a placeholder for an earlier removed field.

              itrealvalue %ld
                          The  time in jiffies before the next SIGALRM is sent
                          to the process due to an interval timer.  Since kerâ
                          nel  2.6.17, this field is no longer maintained, and
                          is hard coded as 0.

              starttime %llu (was %lu before Linux 2.6)
                          The time in jiffies the process started after system

              rss %ld     Resident  Set  Size: number of pages the process has
                          in real memory.  This is just the pages which  count
                          towards  text,  data, or stack space.  This does not
                          include pages which have not been demand-loaded  in,
                          or which are swapped out.

              rsslim %lu  Current  soft  limit  in  bytes  on  the  rss of the

                          stack.

              kstkeip %lu The current EIP (instruction pointer).

              signal %lu  The  bitmap of pending signals, displayed as a deciâ
                          mal number.  Obsolete, because it does  not  provide
                          information     on     real-time     signals;    use
                          /proc/[pid]/status instead.

                          /proc/[pid]/status instead.

              sigignore %lu
                          The  bitmap of ignored signals, displayed as a deciâ
                          mal number.  Obsolete, because it does  not  provide
                          information     on     real-time     signals;    use
                          /proc/[pid]/status instead.

              sigcatch %lu
                          The bitmap of caught signals, displayed as a decimal
                          number.   Obsolete,  because  it  does  not  provide
                          information    on     real-time     signals;     use
                          /proc/[pid]/status instead.

              wchan %lu   This  is the "channel" in which the process is waitâ

                          looked  up in a namelist if you need a textual name.
                          (If you have an up-to-date /etc/psdatabase, then try
