1. Compilation & installation.



Download EMBERA V_0.2 using a SVN client from the following address:

2. Examples

The "examples" directory contains several examples of component creation, component connection
and message interchange among components.

2.1. The "helloworld" example implements a client - server behavior between two components, without any observation.

2.2. The "hello-observation" example implements the same task with the observer

2.3. The "pi" example computes the value of pi, with one master thread and 4 slaves threads to do the computation.

2.4. The "imageTiff" example inverts the colors of a Tiff image. The libtiff needs to be installed to compile this example.

2.5. The "mjpeg" example decodes a mjpeg video (located in the examples/mjpeg/video folder).
